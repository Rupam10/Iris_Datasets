# Iris_Datasets
- In the following project, I applied three different machine learning algorithms to predict the different type of iris flower.

# Dataset
- The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

- Attribute Information:-

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5.species: -- Iris Setosa -- Iris Versicolour -- Iris Virginica
